# Release Notes - Version 1.0.1

## What's New

This update fixes compatibility issues with ChatGPT 5.2 and improves discoverability with a clearer extension name.

### Changes

**Extension Renamed**: The extension is now called "Kity ChatGPT Navigator" (previously just "Kity") for better discoverability in the Chrome Web Store. The short name remains "Kity".

### Bug Fixes

**Fixed scrolling in ChatGPT 5.2**: The keyboard scrolling feature (Ctrl+Up/Down) now works correctly with ChatGPT's latest version 5.2, which introduced a new virtual scrolling system.

### For Chrome Web Store Submission

**Short Description for "What's new in this version":**
```
Renamed to "Kity ChatGPT Navigator" for better discoverability. Fixed scrolling compatibility with ChatGPT 5.2 - Ctrl+Up/Down keyboard shortcuts now work correctly with ChatGPT's new virtual scrolling implementation.
```

**Detailed Description (if needed):**
```
This update includes two improvements:

1. Extension Renamed: Now called "Kity ChatGPT Navigator" instead of just "Kity" to make it easier to find in the Chrome Web Store. The functionality remains exactly the same.

2. ChatGPT 5.2 Bug Fix: Restores the scrolling functionality (Ctrl+Up/Down) that stopped working after ChatGPT updated to version 5.2. ChatGPT's new virtual scrolling mechanism required changes to how the extension detects and interacts with the scroll container.

The fix maintains backward compatibility with older ChatGPT versions, so the extension will continue to work if OpenAI rolls back or changes their implementation.

No new permissions required. No user action needed after updating.
